**React Bootstrap Project**

This project is a responsive React application built using Bootstrap for layout and styling. It consists of several components that replicate the design provided in images and includes features like carousels, forms with validation, and hover effects.

Features
Responsive Layout: The project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring proper display across all device sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile).
Bootstrap Integration: All components are styled using Bootstrap to ensure consistency and responsiveness.
Image Carousel: A functional image carousel that scrolls horizontally, with automatic scrolling for mobile devices and click-to-scroll functionality on desktop.
Form Validation: The email subscription form includes input validation with error messages displayed for invalid input.
Hover Animations: Buttons and links include hover animations for better user interaction (e.g., the arrow moves on hover in the "Learn More" section).
Social Media Links: Each team member card includes social media icons with working links.
